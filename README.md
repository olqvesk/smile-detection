This project uses deep learning to detect whether the person is smiling or not smiling. This was done with the source above.  

*"a complete end-to-end application that can detect smiles in a video stream in real-time using deep learning along with traditional computer vision techniques."*  
*"we’ll be training the LetNet architecture on a dataset of images that contain faces of people who are smiling and not smiling. Once our network is trained, we’ll create a separate Python script — this one will detect faces in images via OpenCV’s built-in Haar cascade face detector, extract the face region of interest (ROI) from the image, and then pass the ROI through LeNet for smile detection."*
